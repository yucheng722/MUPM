Paper "Analysis of Image-and-Text Uncertainty Propagation in Multimodal Large Language Models with Cardiac MR-Based Applications"

1. Data Preprocessing: run ...\text\generate_bg.py to generate different text inputs.

2. Get MLLM Predictions: run MLLM.py to obtain image-only, text-only, and image-text branches outputs.

3. Uncertainty Estimation and MUPM modelling: run MUPM.py to estimate image-only, text-only and image-text only uncertainties, and model MUPM.
